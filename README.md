A work-in-progress mega-collaboration [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/) mod, created by the Avant Team.

As the repository description says, this is not a fully publicized workspace of the mod. Most contents that are finished or
worth showing are released here, while the critically secret or completely unfinished ones remains private. Not intended to
be played by the average player-base; this only aims for additional developing hands, suggestions, and balancing feedback.
